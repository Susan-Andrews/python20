#What is a Leap Year? It takes approximately 365.25 days for our planet Earth to orbit the Sun â€” that is a solar year. We usually round the days in a calendar year to 365, that is 365 days in a year. To make up for the missing partial day, we add one day to our calendar approximately every four years and that is known as a leap year.
